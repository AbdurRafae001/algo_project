# LinkedIn Post - SafarPak Project

---

🚀 **Excited to share my latest project: SafarPak - A Route Planning System for Pakistan!**

As part of my **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course, I developed a comprehensive route planning application that implements Dijkstra's Algorithm from scratch to find optimal paths between any locations across Pakistan.

## 🎯 **Project Highlights:**

✅ **Core Algorithm Implementation**
• Implemented Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm from scratch using min-heap priority queue
• Calculated edge weights using Haversine formula for accurate geospatial distances
• Applied road factor adjustments for realistic travel distances

✅ **Interactive Web Application**
• Built with Streamlit for seamless user experience
• Interactive map visualization with animated route display
• Support for any location in Pakistan (cities, landmarks, airports, areas)

✅ **Advanced Features**
• 🧭 **Drive Mode**: Live navigation interface with turn-by-turn directions
• 🚗 **Multi-Modal Routing**: Car, bike, cycle, and walking routes
• ⛽ **Fuel Cost Calculator**: Estimates travel expenses based on vehicle average
• ⏱️ **Travel Time Estimation**: Configurable speed settings for different vehicles
• 📍 **Nearby Places**: Discover restaurants, hotels, cafes, and parks along your route
• 💾 **Offline Support**: Save routes as TXT/JSON files for offline access

✅ **UI/UX Excellence**
• Three theme modes: Dark, Light, and Color Blind accessible
• Fully responsive design for all screen sizes
• Modern, intuitive interface with real-time route analytics

## 💻 **Technical Stack:**
• Python | Pandas | Streamlit | Folium
• Graph Algorithms | Geospatial Calculations
• Data Processing & Visualization

This project demonstrates the practical application of graph algorithms in solving real-world routing problems, combining algorithmic efficiency with user-centric design.
